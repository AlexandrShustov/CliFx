### v1.1 (16-Mar-2020)

- Changed `IConsole` interface (and as a result, `SystemConsole` and `VirtualConsole`) to support writing binary data. Instead of `TextReader`/`TextWriter` instances, the streams are now exposed as `StreamReader`/`StreamWriter` which provide the `BaseStream` property that allows raw access. Existing usages inside commands should remain the same because `StreamReader`/`StreamWriter` are compatible with their base classes `TextReader`/`TextWriter`, but if you were using `VirtualConsole` in tests, you may have to update it to the new API. Refer to the readme for more info.
- Changed argument binding behavior so that an error is produced if the user provides an argument that doesn't match with any parameter or option. This is done in order to improve user experience, as otherwise the user may make a typo without knowing that their input wasn't taken into account.
- Changed argument binding behavior so that options can be set to multiple argument values while specifying them with mixed naming. For example, `--option value1 -o value2 --option value3` would result in the option being set to corresponding three values, assuming `--option` and `-o` match with the same option.
